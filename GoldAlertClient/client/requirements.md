## Packages
framer-motion | For smooth animations of price updates and alerts
lucide-react | Icon library (already in base but good to be explicit)
date-fns | For formatting update times

## Notes
Mocking gold price updates on the client side using setInterval.
Polling API for alerts list to sync with backend.
Sound effect for alerts would be a nice touch if possible, but will rely on Toasts.
